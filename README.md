# catchem_ideas

It's an app I use for writing down ideas for my future projects and having them nicely sorted in time so I can have them all in one place and come back to it later.

It uses Bloc, Firebase, Retrofit, Injectable and Freezed.

Unit and Bloc tests are inlcuded.

For future I plan to make it a little social app with groups for brainstorming.

Also I want to add different inputs like photos and videos or voice recordings for people to share.
